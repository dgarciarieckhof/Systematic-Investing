# Systematic Investment Ideas Repository
Welcome to the Systematic Investment Ideas repository! This is a collection of ideas and resources related to systematic investment.

## Overview
Systematic investment refers to investment strategies that are based on mathematical models and algorithms, rather than human intuition or judgment. These strategies aim to capture predictable patterns in the financial markets, such as momentum, value, or volatility, and generate consistent returns over time.

The purpose of this repository is to gather and share knowledge about systematic investment, including theoretical concepts, practical applications, and real-world examples.
